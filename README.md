## Project 1
In this lab, we worked with instruction encoding for a miniature assembly language, translated instructions into binary, operated an FPGA to run these instructions and saw the output on a PuTTY window, observed and analyzed the results and waveforms of the testbench, and made changes to the testbench code to make its output more readable and its input easier to change. In Part 3 and 4, we learned how to analyze waveforms to understand what signal frequencies stand for and their timing relationships and how data is concatenated and assigned. With this knowledge, we modified the existing code so that the system works in the way we wanted.
